# 30 Days of Code - Day 6

After taking Sunday off, I'm back on track with my #30DaysOfCode challenge! Today, I continued my journey with React, focusing on the `useContext` hook and building a couple of projects to solidify my learning.

## Day 6 Highlights

### 1. React Learning: Exploring the `useContext` Hook
- **Concepts Covered:**
  - Implemented the `useContext` hook to manage state across components.
  - Created a project named **Context API Project**, which includes login and profile components.
  - Learned about passing data in React, making state management more efficient and easier to handle.

### 2. React Projects

1. **Context API Project:**
   - **Objective:** Implement `useContext` to manage and pass data across multiple components.
   - **Components:** Login and Profile
   - **Focus:** Understanding how `useContext` simplifies state management.

2. **Calculator Project:**
   - **Objective:** Build a calculator in React.
   - **Styling:** Used Tailwind CSS for a clean and responsive UI.
   - **Focus:** Practice creating interactive UIs with React.


## How to Run

### React Projects
1. Navigate to the project directory (e.g., `React/context-api-project`).
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the project using `npm start`.

## What's Next?
Tomorrow, I plan to explore more advanced React concepts, build new projects, and dive deeper into the world of frontend development.
