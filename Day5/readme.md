# 30 Days of Code - Day 5

Welcome to Day 5 of my #30DaysOfCode challenge! Today was incredibly productive as I delved deeper into JavaScript and React, revisiting essential concepts and building multiple projects.

## Day 5 Highlights

### 1. JavaScript Concepts Revision
- **Revised:** Arrow functions and callback functions.
- **Source:** W3Schools

### 2. React Tutorials on W3Schools
Today, I completed several React tutorials on W3Schools, which helped reinforce my understanding of React's core concepts. Hereâ€™s what I covered:
- **React Home**
- **React Intro**
- **React Get Started**
- **React Upgrade**
- **React ES6**
- **React Render HTML**
- **React JSX**
- **React Components**
- **React Class**
- **React Props**
- **React Events**
- **React Conditionals**
- **React Lists**
- **React Forms**
- **React Router**
- **React Memo**
- **React CSS Styling**
- **React Hooks:**
  - What is a Hook?
  - `useState`
  - `useEffect`
  - `useContext`
  - `useRef`
  - `useReducer`
  - `useCallback`
  - `useMemo`
  - Custom Hooks

### 3. React Projects
Today, I worked on three different React projects to put my learning into practice:

1. **Custom Hooks Project:**
   - **Objective:** Create a custom hook to fetch and display data.
   - **API Used:** JSONPlaceholder API

2. **OTP Authentication System:**
   - **Objective:** Develop a high user experience OTP authentication system.
   - **Focus:** User interface and seamless user experience.

3. **Portfolio Site with React Router:**
   - **Objective:** Implement a portfolio site with multiple pages (Home, About, Contact, Blogs).
   - **Technologies Used:**
     - **React Router:** For routing between pages.
     - **Tailwind CSS:** For styling the site.


## How to Run

### React Projects
1. Navigate to the project directory (e.g., `React/custom-hooks`).
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the project using `npm start`.

## What's Next?
Tomorrow, I plan to continue exploring React, work on more projects, and dive into additional JavaScript concepts.
