# 30 Days of Code - Day 2

Welcome to Day 2 of my #30DaysOfCode challenge! Today, I focused on expanding my React skills, revisiting some essential Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA) concepts, and solving a LeetCode problem.

## Day 2 Highlights

### 1. React Project - Password Generator
- **Project:** Password Generator
- **Concepts Used:**
  - `useState` for managing the password state.
  - `useRef` for referencing DOM elements.
  - `useCallback` for memoizing functions to optimize performance.
  - `useEffect` for side effects like updating the UI when the password changes.
- **Functionality:**
  - Developed a React app that generates random passwords based on selected criteria such as length and character types.

### 2. DSA Revision - Sorting Algorithms & LinkedList
- **Sorting Algorithms:**
  - **Bubble Sort:** Implemented and revised the basic bubble sort algorithm, which repeatedly steps through the list, compares adjacent elements, and swaps them if they are in the wrong order.
  - **Selection Sort:** Revised the selection sort algorithm, which divides the list into a sorted and an unsorted part, and repeatedly selects the smallest element from the unsorted part to add to the sorted part.
  
- **LinkedList Revision:**
  - **Implementation:** Revised the linked list data structure, focusing on its implementation and understanding the underlying structure.
  - **Collection Class:** Reviewed the LinkedList collection class in Java, which is part of the Java Collections Framework.
  - **Basic Operations:** Practiced fundamental operations like adding elements, removing elements, and checking the size of the LinkedList.

### 3. LeetCode Problem Solved
- **Problem:** [Single Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/single-number/)
- **Approaches:**
  1. **Brute Force:** Iterated through the array, checking for the single element that appears only once.
  2. **Sorting:** Sorted the array first and then searched for the single element.

## How to Run

### DSA - Java Programs
1. Navigate to the relevant directories (`Sorting` or `LinkedList`) under `DSA`.
2. Compile the Java files using `javac <filename>.java`.
3. Run the compiled classes using `java <ClassName>`.

### React Project
1. Navigate to the `React/password-generator` directory.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the project using `npm start`.

### LeetCode Solutions
1. Navigate to the `LeetCode` directory.
2. Compile and run the Java files for each approach to the problem.

## What's Next?
Looking forward to Day 3, where I’ll continue exploring more complex topics in DSA, building more React projects, and solving additional LeetCode challenges!
