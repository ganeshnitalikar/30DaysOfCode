# 30 Days of Code - Day 4

Welcome to Day 4 of my #30DaysOfCode challenge! Today, I focused on building a functional React project and revisited some important Operating System (OS) concepts.

## Day 4 Highlights

### 1. React Project - Student Registration Form
- **Project:** Student Registration Form
- **Concepts Used:**
  - **React Hooks:** Used `useState` for managing form state and handling user inputs.
  - **Tailwind CSS:** Styled the form using Tailwind CSS, which provided a quick and responsive design solution.

### 2. OS Concepts Revision
Today’s study session involved a thorough revision of fundamental Operating System concepts. Here's what I covered:
- **What is an OS?:** Reviewed the basic definition and purpose of an operating system.
- **Types of OS:** Discussed different types of operating systems, including batch, time-sharing, distributed, and real-time OS.
- **Processes, Threads, and Programs:** Explored the differences between processes, threads, and programs.
- **Process Lifecycle:** Revisited the various stages in a process’s lifecycle.
- **Thread Lifecycle:** Reviewed the lifecycle of a thread in a multithreading environment.
- **CPU Scheduling:** Studied various CPU scheduling algorithms and their importance in process management.

## How to Run

### React Project
1. Navigate to the `React/student-registration-form` directory.
2. Install dependencies using `npm install`.
3. Run the project using `npm start`.

## What's Next?
Looking forward to Day 5, where I plan to dive deeper into both React development and OS concepts, along with solving more algorithmic challenges!
