# 30 Days of Code - Day 3

Welcome to Day 3 of my #30DaysOfCode challenge! Today, I focused on building a practical React project and solved several LeetCode problems that reinforced my understanding of arrays and number manipulation.

## Day 3 Highlights

### 1. React Project - Currency Converter
- **Project:** Currency Converter
- **Concepts Used:**
  - **Frankfurter API:** Integrated the Frankfurter API for real-time currency conversion.
  - **React Fundamentals:** Continued practice with state management, API requests, and rendering dynamic content based on user input.

### 2. LeetCode Problems Solved
I tackled a series of LeetCode problems that covered various concepts such as arrays, digit manipulation, and simple mathematical operations.

- **[Concatenation of Arrays](https://leetcode.com/problems/concatenation-of-array/):** Created a new array by concatenating a given array to itself.
- **[Find Numbers with Even Number of Digits](https://leetcode.com/problems/find-numbers-with-even-number-of-digits/):** Counted how many numbers in a list contain an even number of digits.
- **[Palindrome Number](https://leetcode.com/problems/palindrome-number/):** Checked if a given integer is a palindrome.
- **[Richest Customer Wealth](https://leetcode.com/problems/richest-customer-wealth/):** Found the wealthiest customer by summing the wealth across multiple bank accounts.
- **[Running Sum of 1d Array](https://leetcode.com/problems/running-sum-of-1d-array/):** Calculated the running sum of a 1D array.
- **[Subtract the Product and Sum of Digits of an Integer](https://leetcode.com/problems/subtract-the-product-and-sum-of-digits-of-an-integer/):** Solved a problem involving digit manipulation by finding the difference between the product and sum of an integer's digits.
